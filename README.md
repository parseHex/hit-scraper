# HIT Scraper

## Building

- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- The built script will be at `build/hit-scraper.user.js`

**Note about `pnpm`**: It looks like (without looking too much into it) that `rollup-plugin-typescript2` works in a way that is broken when using `pnpm`. So use `yarn` until that's maybe fixed some day.
